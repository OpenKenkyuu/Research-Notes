# Defining the problem

When thinking about lists that rank certain stuff, most likely we can think of a ranking that is centralized, therefore, arbitrary to add or remove things due to personal preference of the owner of the list, or even worse, due to not legit reasons (*corruption*).

To solve this, we have **decentralized** and t**rsutless systems**.

# TCRs 101

**Token curated registries** do away with the need of a centralized *list owner*, and instead, they create economic incentives for a decentralized and trsutless list curation mechanism.

- TCRs are lists which have their **own** native token that anyone can buy.
- As a token holder, your incentive is to mantain a **popular**, **high-quality** list that *attracts* applicants who want to add their data to your list.
- An application may be:
	- **Challenged**
	- **Accepted**
- If **challenged**, token holders may vote to either accept or reject the application.
	- If it turns out that the application is rejected, the Applicant’s deposit is split between the Challenger and Token Holders who voted to reject.
- If **accepted** the data is added to the list, and the Applicant keeps their deposit. The Challenger’s deposit is forfeit and split between the Applicant and Token Holders who voted to accept.
